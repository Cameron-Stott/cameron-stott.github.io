								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/grad1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p class= "a">My name is Cameron Stott. Engineering and design have been an interest and passion of mine from a young age, and I have committed much of my personal time and education to pursuing a career in this field. As a person with a very inquisitive and technically oriented mentality, I have always enjoyed designing and working with machinery. To achieve this ambition, I have completed both a HNC (Higher National Certificate) and subsequent HND (Higher National Diploma) in Engineering Systems as well as going on to achieve a Bachelor’s Degree in Mechanical Engineering at Heriot Watt University.</p>
								<p class= "a">I pride myself on my intuitiveness, eagerness to learn and versatility. I can look at complex problems from a practical as well as logical perspective and develop new and unique ideas, using problem solving and analysis to discover faults, solve problems, and implement improvements to current processes. I can adapt my abilities and perspectives to new tasks and skillsets to learn quickly and further develop myself. In both group settings as well as individually I approach everything with an open mind, enthusiasm, and optimistic attitude. </p>
								<p class= "a">Due to my experience at both university and in the workplace, I have become far more confident when working with others, comparing ideas and public speaking. I pride myself on being approachable and listening to the concerns and opinions of others, allowing me to excel both in a team environment and independently. I consistently ensure that I learn from previous mistakes and treat them as a learning opportunity going forward rather than a reason to doubt my abilities and lose confidence. I feel that this is a crucial trait to the modern engineer and one that will strengthen not only the wellbeing of individual engineers but the industry as a whole.</p>
								<p class= "a">I flourish when I am able to apply my technical skills and creativity in engineering practice. I often spend my free time CAD modelling and 3D printing as it allows me to think creatively and problem solve to design a refined final product, such as robotic arms and features, automotive components and modifications for existing products. Through this hobby I have become proficient in numerous CAD modelling software including Autodesk Inventor, AutoCAD, Fusion 360 and Solidworks.</p>
								<p class= "a">I have particular interests in robotics, renewable energies and the space industry. I hope to explore a career in these fields and broaden my knowledge. I am eager to expand my skills professionally and personally, developing myself as a person and as an engineer.</p>

								<p class="a">As part of a project during my third year at university, I was tasked with designing a robotic arm with 5 axes of rotation which could withstand a force of 10N exerted on its end-effector. The arm was modelled off of industrial robots used in the automotive industry and completed entirely within CAD with no physical prototype being constructed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This resulted in a unique set of challenges throughout the project; with no access to the workshop, all development and testing had to be completed through calculation. This involved conducting extensive research into the ideal materials to construct the arm from as well as the machinery and manufacturing processes which would be required. I also had to decide upon the most ideal method of movement for the system, with consideration being given to ease and accuracy of control, force output, reliability and ease of maintenance.</p>
								<p class="a">After conducting theoretical analysis, it was decided that the robot would consist of an aluminium sub-frame actuated by servo motors. The connecting wires and fragile components would be housed within a 3D printed shell in order to increase the arm’s durability, reduce maintenance needs and improve the design aesthetically. The arm would also be equipped with an actuating aluminium claw, providing adequate dexterity while allowing small or fragile items to be picked up with precision by accurately controlling the clamping force through the connected servo motor.</p>
								<p class="a">The project was then designed within Autodesk Inventor, keeping in mind the optimum manufacturing methods for each component. This resulted in the arm being constructed from CNC milled fitments, 3D printed casings, welded sub-frame pieces as well as securing steel nuts and bolts throughout. The design had to be produced in such a way that it could be hypothetically manufactured using tools and equipment available in the university workshop, this meant that certain manufacturing processes like injection moulding and casting were simply not feasible, though they would be more ideal for mass-production.</p>
								<p class="a">As no prototype was constructed, the arm was tested digitally using FEA analysis and kinematic calculations within Matlab to simulate multiple movement scenarios, for example lifting a weight from an elevated position and moving it to ground level, as well as raising it back up to a raised position. This effectively tested the links and joints of the robot in durability, dexterity and efficiency. The project was an overall success, with the CAD model being noted as particularly detailed and used as an example by my lecturer.</p>

								<p class="a">For my HND dissertation I chose to design and manufacture an exoskeletal arm to significantly increase the lifting capacity of the wearer as well as reduce repetitive strain during manual handling tasks. The arm consisted of an aluminium frame with a supporting 3D-printed ABS structure. An 120mm pneumatic cylinder with a maximum pressure of 10 Bar provides adequate lifting force to the arm whilst allowing for safe and accurate control via the exoskeleton’s on-board microcontroller. Using an Arduino, a simple control system was created using a push button located in the handle as a trigger which would release air into the pneumatic through a solenoid valve, resulting in the arm performing a ‘curl’ to imitate the wearer’s bicep and assist during a lift.</p>
								<p class="a">The arm’s design went through several iterations before the final prototype was manufactured, from basic initial sketches and notes outlining the purpose of the project and its form, to more refined drawings and CAD models. Once the mock-ups were satisfactory, a final CAD model was created in conjunction with the physical prototype in the workshop, allowing for a near identical digital prototype which could be vigorously tested using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). This meant the physical prototype could be used to test factors like comfort, weight and manoeuvrability while its digital counterpart could be safely tested to its limits of strength and durability. </p>
								<p class="a">In its final testing phase, the arm’s shoulder was clamped to a solid surface and incrementally tested with increasing weights. In this test, the arm was found to comfortably curl a weight of 20kg. This means that if properly implemented with a full-back structure to more properly distribute the weight, a wearer could lift a safe manual handling load of 25kg with little to no effort, dramatically reducing work-related injury due to manual handling.</p>
								<p class="a">Future improvements to the design would include the aforementioned full-back structure to allow for a more uniform distribution of load across the upper-body, as well as allowing for the addition of a second arm. With an increased budget, the pneumatic system could be replaced with motorised linear actuators, increasing the safety of the design by eliminating the risk of leaks from the high-pressure system or snagging hoses as well as more accurate control.</p>

								<p class="a">A project during my second year at university was to design a ‘line launcher’, a device which can accurately fire a squash ball at a target from a distance between 4 and 6 metres away. To achieve this objective, I opted to use a pneumatic cylinder to fire the ball as this would provide adequate propulsion and control. A simple aluminium frame would mount a 3D printed barrel at a set 45° angle to a wooden base, allowing for firing distance to be directly proportional to the pneumatic pressure applied.</p>
								<p class="a">While constructing the prototype which would be used in final testing it was found that the original design, which consisted of a long barrel with a flat-ended pneumatic pushrod, drastically underperformed compared to the expected results from calculations. It was found that a significant amount of friction and back-pressure was generated between the barrel and the pushrod, resulting in a reduction in firing power. To overcome this issue, the design was altered to have a far shorter barrel and a bowl-shaped end on the pushrod which perfectly matched the surface of the squash ball. This alteration provided the same accuracy as the long barrel, while vastly improving the firing power. </p>
								<p class="a">For safety purposes, the project specified that the system had to be triggered remotely. This resulted in the development of an Arduino-powered control system. Due to the fixed 45° angle of the barrel, a program was written to calculate the amount of pneumatic pressure required to fire the squash ball a pre-determined distance based on the parabolic trajectory of a projectile due to gravity and the mass of the ball. This meant that the line launcher could be pre-set to hit a target at a specified distance in metres. Once the required pressure was reached, air was released into the pneumatic cylinder through a solenoid value using a button on the end of a length of wire as a trigger. This allowed the user to remain a safe distance away from the line launcher while it was pressurised. The project was also limited to a maximum of 5.5 Bar, which was found to be ample pressure to launch the ball short distance but the system was designed to tolerate at least 10 Bar.</p>
