								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/grad1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p class= "a">I’m an engineering professional with over 3.5 years of industry experience, spanning renewable energy and aerospace sectors. With a background in design engineering and assembly, integration, and test (AIT), I bring a multidisciplinary skill set that bridges mechanical design, electronics, and programming.</p>
								<p class= "a">I thrive in roles that demand both creativity and practical execution—particularly where I can design, prototype, and build hands-on solutions. Whether working on renewable systems or spacecraft hardware, I’m drawn to challenges that require systems thinking and a collaborative approach across disciplines.</p>
								<p class= "a">While I’m especially interested in aerospace, robotics, and advanced manufacturing, I’m ultimately motivated by opportunities to create meaningful, functional designs—regardless of the field. I’m always looking to contribute to innovative teams where curiosity, adaptability, and technical rigour are valued.</p>

									<h5>Renewables Design Engineer (Full-Time Employment)</h5>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/Everwarm1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p class= "a">This position has allowed me to apply my knowledge gained at university in a professional environment. Working in the renewable energies sector, my role is primarily to design retrofit air-source heat pump systems for client’s domestic properties, this included creating accurate floorplans in CAD, calculating room-by-room heat losses based on EPC data and material u-values, as well as sizing radiators to oppose the heat loss and warm the home. I have learned to work maturely in a professional setting, work effectively to strict deadlines and communicate productively with my design team, surveyors and managers.
										In this role I have also designed retrofit solar panel and electric vehicle charging point (EVCP) schematics as well as location maps for properties receiving upgrades. While working in conjunction with Scottish Power, I helped to develop a system to automatically calculate initial quotes based on approved pricings and EPC data. This dramatically increased workflow whilst reducing time spent per job and allowed designers to work more efficiently.</p>

							<div class="DropContent">
								<h4>Duration: 1 Year</h4>

								<p class="a">For my HND dissertation I chose to design and manufacture an exoskeletal arm to significantly increase the lifting capacity of the wearer as well as reduce repetitive strain during manual handling tasks. The arm consisted of an aluminium frame with a supporting 3D-printed ABS structure. An 120mm pneumatic cylinder with a maximum pressure of 10 Bar provides adequate lifting force to the arm whilst allowing for safe and accurate control via the exoskeleton’s on-board microcontroller. Using an Arduino, a simple control system was created using a push button located in the handle as a trigger which would release air into the pneumatic through a solenoid valve, resulting in the arm performing a ‘curl’ to imitate the wearer’s bicep and assist during a lift.<br><br>
									The arm’s design went through several iterations before the final prototype was manufactured, from basic initial sketches and notes outlining the purpose of the project and its form, to more refined drawings and CAD models. Once the mock-ups were satisfactory, a final CAD model was created in conjunction with the physical prototype in the workshop, allowing for a near identical digital prototype which could be vigorously tested using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). This meant the physical prototype could be used to test factors like comfort, weight and manoeuvrability while its digital counterpart could be safely tested to its limits of strength and durability. <br><br>
									In its final testing phase, the arm’s shoulder was clamped to a solid surface and incrementally tested with increasing weights. In this test, the arm was found to comfortably curl a weight of 20kg. This means that if properly implemented with a full-back structure to more properly distribute the weight, a wearer could lift a safe manual handling load of 25kg with little to no effort, dramatically reducing work-related injury due to manual handling.<br><br>
									Future improvements to the design would include the aforementioned full-back structure to allow for a more uniform distribution of load across the upper-body, as well as allowing for the addition of a second arm. With an increased budget, the pneumatic system could be replaced with motorised linear actuators, increasing the safety of the design by eliminating the risk of leaks from the high-pressure system or snagging hoses as well as more accurate control.
